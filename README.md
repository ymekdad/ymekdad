Hi! This is Yassine Mekdad,

I am a cybersecurity PhD student. I hold a Msc in Cryptography and Information Security and a Bsc in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My research interest principally cover challenging security problems in Cyber-physical systems (CPS). 
In particular, the security and privacy topics in the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and Cyber-physical systems (CPS). 

Furthermore, I work on the security of critical infrastructure networks (e.g., SCADA systems, smart-grid). 

I am also interested on research problems at the intersection of the cybersecurity and networking fields with an emphasis on their practical and applied aspects. 

Currently, I am focusing on the following research areas:

    Security and privacy issues of IoT and IIoT.
    Cyber threat intelligence for Industry 4.0.
    Security and privacy issues of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
    Malware detection and analysis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

I am always eager to work extra mile with strongly motivated and passionate people in order to solve some of the most pressing current issues in cybersecurity.
If you are interested, please drop me an email: mekdadyassine@gmail.com
